# Batch-Landscape-Metrics
Landscape Metrics can be a great way to assess the health and fragmentation of ecosystems, although landcover classification layers may be split up into multiple files such as the case with the Hawaiian Islands. This script streamlines the analytical process by accepting a folder of landcover classification layers to be processed.
